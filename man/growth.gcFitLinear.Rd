\description{
Determine maximum growth rates from the log-linear part of a growth curve using
a heuristic approach similar to the ``growth rates made easy''-method of
Hall et al. (2013).
}
\details{
The algorithm works as follows:
\enumerate{
\item Fit linear regressions (Theil-Sen estimator) to all subsets of \code{h} consecutive, log-transformed data
points (sliding window of size \code{h}). If for example \eqn{h=5}, fit a linear regression to points
1 \dots 5, 2 \dots 6, 3 \dots 7 and so on.
\item Find the subset with the highest slope \eqn{mu_{max}}. Do the \ifelse{html}{\out{R<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{R^2}} and relative standard deviation (RSD) values of the regression meet the in \code{lin.R2} and \code{lin.RSD} defined thresholds and do the data points within the regression window account for a fraction of at least \code{lin.dY} of the total growth increase? If not, evaluate the subset with the second highest slope, and so on.
\item Include also the data points of adjacent subsets that have a slope of at least \eqn{quota \cdot mu{max}}, e.g., all regression windows that have at least 95\% of the maximum slope.
\item Fit a new linear model to the extended data window identified in step 3.
}
If \code{biphasic = TRUE}, the following steps are performed to define a second growth phase:
\enumerate{
\item Perform a smooth spline fit on the data with a smoothing factor of 0.5.
\item Calculate the second derivative of the spline fit and perform a smooth spline fit of the derivative with a smoothing factor of 0.4.
\item Determine local maxima and minima in the second derivative.
\item Find the local minimum following \eqn{mu_{max}} and repeat the heuristic linear method for later time values.
\item Find the local maximum before \eqn{mu_{max}} and repeat the heuristic linear method for earlier time values.
\item Choose the greater of the two independently determined slopes as \eqn{mu_{max}2}.
