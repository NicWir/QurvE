<p><br><em>QurvE</em> is an R package for analyzing growth and
fluorescence data measured over time. It features a graphical user
interface (GUI) developed as a Shiny app, which has been designed to be
user-friendly and intuitive. <em>QurvE</em> offers a variety of analysis
tools to streamline the process of growth profiling and ensure
reproducibility. It can also be used to characterize fluorescence data,
such as in plate reader experiments for biosensor characterization.
Overall, <em>QurvE</em> aims to make data analysis and reporting quick,
efficient, and reliable.</p>

<p><em>QurvE</em> allows loading data in different formats, for both
growth experiments and for fluorescence measurements. Data can be loaded
by using the custom QurvE data layout, by loading raw data from various
measuring equipment or by importing previously analyzed datasets.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="loading-data-formatted-in-the-custom-qurve-layout">Loading data formatted in the custom QurvE layout<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#loading-data-formatted-in-the-custom-qurve-layout"></a>
</h3>
<p>To load data using the custom QurvE layout, select the <span style="color: blue;">[Data] &gt; [Custom]</span> window and choose a
file in .xls/.xlsx (selecting the appropriate work sheets) or
.csv/.tsv/.txt format (define the correct decimal separator and, for
.csv, field separator in the target file). The custom QurvE layout
includes all data and relative metadata necessary for QurvE to perform
the analysis. This custom layout can be used to load both growth and
fluorescence data. Data from a second fluorescence channel can be used
to normalize the primary fluorescence values in addition to
normalization to growth values.</p>
<p>The data must be formatted as displayed in <strong>Figure
1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first row contains ‘Time’, ‘Blank’, and the sample identifiers
(IDs). The ID needs to be identical for replicates and for samples
analyzed together within a dose-response analysis. The ‘Time’ column
must be positioned at the first position, ‘Blank’ and the samples follow
in arbitrary order.</li>
<li>The second row contains replicate numbers for identical conditions.
If technical replicates were used in addition to biological replicates,
indicate technical replicates with identical replicate numbers. Samples
with identical IDs, replicate numbers, and concentration values (if
applicable) will be combined by their average values at each time point.
Leave the row empty if no replicate information is available.</li>
<li>The third row is designated to contain concentration values to
perform a dose-response analysis, if different concentrations of a
compound were used in the experiment. Samples are included in the same
dose-response analysis if they have identical sample identifiers (first
row). Leave the row empty if no concentration information is available
or relevant.</li>
<li>Starting with the fourth row, the table must include data for
‘Time’, ‘Blank’ and the different samples.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several experiments can be combined into a single custom dataset.
Different experiments with differing time values and experiment-specific
blanks are distinguished by an individual ‘Time’ column to the left of
each dataset. Blank values (experiment-specific) are combined as their
average and subtracted from all remaining values if the option <span style="color: blue;">[Subtract blank]</span> is selected. The metadata
on the second and third row is optional to perform the analysis; if no
such metadata is available, leave the rows empty.</p>
<p>The data can be further processed by (options indicated in the order
in which they are applied to the data):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>converting time values,</p></li>
<li><p>applying a calibration equation to measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>subtracting the blank values from each sample
measurement,</p></li>
<li><p>normalizing fluorescence data with a second fluorescence or
growth dataset, if available.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All these data processing functions are optional.</p>

<h3 id="loading-tidy-data">Loading Tidy Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#loading-tidy-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>QurvE</code> Shiny application is not limited to the custom
QurvE layout; it also supports the direct loading of tidy data, a widely
used format in data science.</p>
<p>Tidy data, also known as ‘long’ format, is a standardized way of
organizing data values within a dataset. It provides a straightforward,
flexible structure that is highly suitable for various forms of analysis
and visualization in R.</p>
<p>To upload data in tidy format, navigate to the <span style="color: blue;">[Data] &gt; [Custom]</span> window and select the
appropriate file in .xls/.xlsx format (specifying the relevant
worksheets) or .csv/.tsv/.txt format (remembering to set the correct
decimal separator and, for .csv, the field separator).</p>
<p>Columns required in tidy data format:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>“Time”</strong>: Each row in this column contains the time
values for your observations.</li>
<li>
<strong>“Description”</strong>: Each row in this column contains a
sample description. This can be a combination of the organism and
condition or any other relevant descriptor.</li>
<li>
<strong>“Values”</strong>: Each row in this column contains the
measured values from your experiment (e.g., optical density, cell count,
etc.).</li>
<li>
<strong>“Replicate”</strong> (optional): If you have multiple
replicate measurements for the same condition (“Description” labels),
you can indicate the replicate number in this column.</li>
<li>
<strong>“Concentration”</strong> (optional): If there’s a compound
added to the sample, you can record its concentration in this
column.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon uploading, <code>QurvE</code> automatically detects if the data
is in tidy format and processes it accordingly.</p>
<p>Note: For <code>QurvE</code> to correctly process tidy data, it’s
crucial to ensure the column headers in your uploaded data match exactly
with those specified above.</p>
<p>The same data processing options described in the previous section
are available also for tidy data.</p>
<p>Using tidy data allows you to leverage the power of
<code>QurvE</code> with a wide range of datasets, increasing the
versatility of your analysis pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="loading-data-from-raw-experiment-files">Loading data from raw experiment files<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#loading-data-from-raw-experiment-files"></a>
</h3>
<p><em>QurvE</em> supports loading directly raw data produced by a
variety of proprietary software for different growth or fluorescence
measuring equipment, such as plate readers and micro-bioreactors<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content='&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;QurvE&lt;/em&gt; does not include a &lt;strong&gt;data

continually working on adding support for more equipment and software.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a>. This can
be done in the <span style="color: blue;">[Data] &gt; [Parse Raw
Data]</span> window.</p>
<p>After loading the file (1), selecting the correct raw data format by
choosing one of the available equipments/software (2) and assigning the
extracted read channels to growth/fluorescence data (3), the user has to
provide mapping information with metadata in tabular format (in a
.xls/.xlsx/.csv/.tsv/.txt file) (4).</p>
<p>The mapping file should be formatted as shown in <strong>Figure
2</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first column contains the well numbers in the plate and must
match sample identifiers in the raw data file.</li>
<li>The second column contains the ID (i.e., organism, condition, etc.)
of each sample. The ID needs to be identical for replicates and for
samples analyzed together within a dose-response analysis.</li>
<li>The third column contains replicate numbers for identical
conditions. If technical replicates were used in addition to biological
replicates, indicate technical replicates with the same replicate
number. Samples with identical IDs, replicate numbers, and concentration
values (if applicable) will be combined by their average values at each
time point. Leave the row empty if no replicate information is
available.</li>
<li>The fourth column is designated to contain concentration values to
perform a dose-response analysis, if different concentrations of a
compound of interest were used in the experiment. Leave the row empty if
no additional concentration information is available.</li>
</ul>
<p>The values in ‘Blank’ samples are combined by their averages and
subtracted from all remaining values if the option <span style="color: blue;">[Subtract blank]</span> is chosen.</p>
<p>The data can be further processed by (options indicated in the order
in which they are applied to the data):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>converting time values,</p></li>

<p>Once raw data is loaded, <em>QurvE</em> can be used to process the
data by fitting curves, calculating averages and standard deviations for
replicates, as well as fitting the data with different models to obtain
growth parameters such as doubling times, yields, etc., or dose-response
parameters. Moreover, the software allows the user to intuitively create
publication-grade plots.</p>

<p>Once the raw data has been successfully parsed, the <span style="color: blue;">[Computation]</span> window will unlock, enabling
the user to process either <span style="color: blue;">Growth</span> or
<span style="color: blue;">Fluorescence</span> data (<strong>Figure
4</strong>). The data can be processed using different curve fitting
methods, which can be selected in the panel on the left. The default
fitting options are the <span style="color: blue;">Linear
regression</span> fit and <span style="color: blue;">Non-parametric
fit</span> (smooth spline). By ticking <span style="color: blue;">Parametric fit</span> (not available for
Fluorescence analysis), parametric growth models models are fit to the
data. By ticking <span style="color: blue;">Log-transform time</span>
the time values are transformed by Ln(1 + time). With <span style="color: blue;">Biphasic growth</span> selected, <em>QurvE</em>
tries to identify a second growth phase while performing <em>linear
regressions</em> and <em>non-parametric fits</em> and extracts
corresponding parameters (e.g., growth rate, lag time until second
growth phase).</p>
<p>Dose-response (EC50) analyses can be performed by either performing a
smooth spline fit (<span style="color: blue;">response spline
fit</span>) on response vs. concentration data and extracting the
<em>EC<sub>50</sub></em> as the concentration at the midpoint between
the largest and smallest response value, or by applying up to 20
(parametric) <span style="color: blue;">dose-response models</span> to
choose the best model based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
Any computed parameter (e.g., growth rates obtained via linear
regression, maximum fluorescence obtained via non-parametric fits…) can
be chosen as response parameter to quantify adverse or beneficial
effects of a substance. The options to <span style="color: blue;">Log-transform concentration</span> or <span style="color: blue;">Log-transform response</span> are only available
for <em>response spline fits</em>. In both instances, Ln(x + 1) is
applied to the respective values.</p>
